Wednesday Goals
- add difficulty setting
    x add difficulty buttons
    - implement button clicks to set difficulty
    - disable and hide buttons after buttons have been clicked
    - re-enable after and show buttons after game restart has been clicked
    - (optional) add restart in same difficulty if possible

- complete hint system (connected with difficulty setting)
    - provide difficulty options at each restart and provide highlighted hints accordingly
        - easy: highlights correct digits with green, multiple correct nums with blue and single correct nums with orange
        - medium: hl correct digits with green and correct nums with orange
        - hard: highlight all pickers with the responses from directions. green if num is right pos, orange if correct num but not spot, blank for no correct

        main will have difficult setting. click button -> set the difficulty rating
        create an array of numbers to indicate the reading output when checking code
        - [0,0,0,0]
        - 0 indicates incorrect
        - 1 indicates value is in the code
        - 2 indicates value is in the correct pos
        colorNumberPicker will respond to request accordingly depending on difficulty
        - if diff 1, color individual pickers based on result
        - if 2, color whole wheel as a response
        - if 0, color individual wheels with additional color of multiples

        - simplify the attempts record with colors based on difficulty



- shift UI around to be more user friendly

- add start screen to provide game instructions
- factor in horizontal mode (test on different device sizes)
- factor in customization (code length, number of attempts)
- add some effects (audio + animation on win, etc)

Thursday
- remove debugging messages
- refactor and cleanup any messy code
- test and get feedback
